Problem:-

Any collaborator tries to pull the code from the remote git repository 
after making his own changes in the code/content at local machine, an extra merge 
commit gets generated by git. However, we can avoid that extra merge 
commit from getting generated.

Reason:-

git pull=git fetch + git merge commands, which will result with an extra commit  and ugly merge bubble
in our commit log.

Solution:- 
we can commit our changes and instead of git pull,  we can fire git pull --rebase <remote-name> <branch-name>.
Basically the rebase take out our commits that we committed on the current branch HEAD as a patch.Then it will
apply all the remote commits on top of HEAD and then apply our commits on the top of it.
Then we can easily pust the progress but some times we have to use git push -f to forcefully push to the
remote repository.
